    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Massaged kale salad with nutritional yeast is an umami lover's dream.
      Massaging the kale makes it perfectly tender with a pleasing crispness.
      The simple but bold dressing comes together right in the bowl.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large bunch curly kale</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>
        3 tablespoons (45 ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about one
        medium lemon)
      </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup (20 grams) nutritional yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tear the kale leaves from their stems and break into bite-sized pieces.
        Wash and dry thoroughly. (Discard stems or save for juicing or pesto.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper over the kale and use
        your hands to massage the dressing into the leaves. Do this however you
        like — you really can't go wrong. In a minute or two, you'll have a
        tender, delicious salad.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with the nutritional yeast for a pop of umami that beautifully
        complements the earthy kale, fruity olive oil and tangy lemon juice.
      </li>
    </ol>
