    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This dish produces a lot of flavorful liquid. You can use it for dipping crusty toasted bread. Or you can remove the chicken, tomatoes, and garlic to a serving dish and pour the strained liquid into a small saucepan and boil until reduced to a thicker sauce. You can pour this sauce back over the chicken or pour it over rice or pasta.</br>
        The recipe calls for bone-in thighs. If you make it with boneless thighs, you may need to reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.</br>
        The recipe calls for skin-on thighs. If you make it with skinless thighs, try to cover the thighs as much as you can with the tomatoes to keep the meat from drying out. If you make it with skinless breasts, do the same, and reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul></ul>
        <li>2 pounds (900g) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (25 to 30) cherry tomatoes (a heaping basket)</li>
        <li>6 whole cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary, or 1/2 teaspoon dry rosemary</li>
        <li>Toasted crusty bread, buttered noodles, or rice, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven:
Set the oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
        <li>Arrange and salt the chicken thighs:
Place chicken thighs in a baking dish that allows for a little room between them. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken thighs with salt.</li>
        <li>Prep the cherry tomatoes:
Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Place in a bowl with the whole garlic cloves. Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Pour the tomato mix over the chicken:
Pour the cherry tomato mixture over the chicken pieces and arrange so that they are squeezed around the chicken pieces. You want the chicken skins to be exposed so they brown in the oven. Lay sprigs of rosemary over the tomatoes.

(If you are using dry rosemary instead of fresh sprigs, just mix it in with the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Bake until well browned:
Bake, uncovered for 45 minutes, until the chicken is well browned on top and cooked through. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. Skim the excess chicken fat with a ladle.</li>
    </ol>
